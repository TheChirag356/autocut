1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,280
The Joe Rogan experience. And by

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,600
the way, also starting in the

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,240
40s, using mercury everywhere.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,880
The very earliest autism cases

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,840
were called Kanner Syndrome

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,840
because of a doctor who

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,920
discovered eight patients who

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,520
all had. He took care of a lot

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,960
of kids and he found this new

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,120
syndrome that he was seeing

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,720
about their behavior. They had

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,280
lost their ability to speak.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,960
They had all kinds of problems.

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,280
And in almost every case, the

15
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,760
father was working with mercury,

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,360
or mercury was being used in

17
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,600
agriculture at that time.

18
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,960
Mercury was like this, you know,

19
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,300
this wonder problem product

20
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,380
because it's effing effective,

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,980
that's for sure. It does shit.

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,700
And so it was in a lot of

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,500
things. So mercury is part of a

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,020
lot of neurological injuries.

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,980
And it's, you know, go on

26
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,580
ChatGPT and say, should I

27
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,460
breathe mercury fumes? No.

28
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,540
Should I eat it? Touch it? No,

29
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,900
no, no. Should I inject it?

30
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,100
Pause, pause, pause. Well, in

31
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,260
childhood vaccines, I mean,

32
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,660
it's just ridiculous. I got a

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,620
quick, quick one, I want to tell

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,770
you. So I'm gonna get a lot of

35
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,890
shit, obviously, for this. And

36
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,050
what's the main criticism you

37
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,610
and I are both gonna get? I'm

38
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,370
not a doctor, I'm not a

39
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,610
scientist. As I mentioned, I'm a

40
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,690
criminologist, and I speak

41
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,330
English and I read very well.

42
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
And so in this book, I put

43
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,010
together the information that

44
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,530
anybody can get and put all the

45
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,170
citations there. But what

46
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,730
parents often don't know is that

47
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,730
this brand vaccine, vaccine

48
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,450
good, disease bad, there's a

49
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,410
ruse in there, there's a

50
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,970
marketing ruse, which is that if

51
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,130
you don't get the vaccine,

52
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,370
you're going to get that

53
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,250
disease. It is absolutely

54
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,250
impossible for your kid to get

55
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,570
all of those diseases or be

56
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,490
exposed to all of those

57
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,970
diseases. And what Humphreys

58
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,530
didn't talk about with you, but

59
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,050
she knows, is that all of the

60
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,090
childhood vaccine diseases, all

61
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,850
of them, the survival rate for a

62
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,320
healthy American child is 100%.

63
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
All of them, yeah. That's

64
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,000
inconvenient. Right. The

65
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,240
measles. Well, let me do measles

66
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,920
real quick because for 22 years,

67
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,240
we didn't have a single, single

68
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,440
measles death in the United

69
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,400
States for 22 years. And this is

70
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,520
the really. This is really

71
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,880
interesting math. I hope people

72
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,680
will take this one on board.

73
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,120
The death rate for vaccinated

74
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,080
children with measles is zero.

75
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
And the death rate for

76
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,780
unvaccinated children, of which

77
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,500
there are 9 million in America,

78
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,380
is zero. Meaning the

79
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,220
unvaccinated and the vaccinated

80
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,060
both have the same death rate,

81
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,580
zero. But people have died from

82
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,140
Measles? Yes, people have died

83
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,220
from measles. But all of these

84
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,180
diseases, the death rates that

85
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,980
are the scariest are old death

86
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,100
rates. Right. First of all,

87
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,300
measles was in descent anyway up

88
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,700
until as it headed into the 80s,

89
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,180
it was already going from, you

90
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,860
know, up here to down here on

91
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,820
the graph. Why is that? Indoor

92
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,020
plumbing, better nutrition.

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,580
The same thing that helped with

94
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,140
almost every disease here.

95
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,740
Texas. Texas announces second

96
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,260
death. But this is 2024. And

97
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,900
what I said was in the 22 years

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,180
before that, there had not been

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,460
a death. So what's causing these

100
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,620
kids to die? Well, it's. I don't

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,860
know if you've had Pierre Cory

102
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,940
on or other people, and I'm not.

103
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,180
This would be a medical question

104
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,520
about whether these kids died of

105
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,960
measles or died of poor medical

106
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,840
care. Died with measles? Yeah,

107
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,080
died with measles, et cetera.

108
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
They have other comorbidities.

109
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Well, they had bad treatment.

110
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,040
It's a question for like

111
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,280
somebody like Pierre Cory. I'm

112
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,320
gonna back away from the

113
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,560
question, by the way. Let's own

114
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,120
it. Let's say, oh, they died of

115
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,760
measles. If that's true, then in

116
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,680
24 years, two kids died of

117
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,760
measles. You know what the death

118
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,090
rate is for kids from. From

119
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,090
tetanus, for example? The risk

120
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,010
is that 1 in every 154 million

121
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,610
Americans, children will die

122
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,730
from tetanus. And if you want to

123
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,970
make those odds better with a

124
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,090
vaccine, more power to you. But

125
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,370
1 in 154 million is pretty damn

126
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,330
good. And then again, very

127
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,810
important, what you said, that

128
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,410
it can be taken, the vaccine can

129
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,890
be taken once you have

130
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,370
contracted tetanus. Well, no,

131
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,650
once you've got the injury, you

132
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,930
don't have to wait if you've got

133
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,010
the injury. But you know this,

134
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,250
there's a ruse here, which is

135
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,810
that deep puncture wounds does

136
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,650
not mean tetanus. Right? Right.

137
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,850
You gotta search for it. And as

138
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,090
you'll see in this book, the

139
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,930
chart that shows the prevalence

140
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,010
of tetanus in the world is an

141
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,330
interesting one. But I wanna

142
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,450
just quickly talk about this

143
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,610
because I'm ready for the shit

144
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,730
that I'm not a doctor and I

145
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,810
shouldn't be saying any of this.

146
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,010
My view is not only should I be

147
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,210
saying it, but I should be doing

148
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,490
exactly what I've done for my

149
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,410
whole career, which is

150
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,170
investigating matters and

151
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,520
telling the truth. And I'm not

152
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,960
even, by the way, an anti

153
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,200
vaxxer. I think there's one

154
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,240
vaccine I think is a great

155
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,720
product, by the way. The BCG

156
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,920
vaccine, which is for

157
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,200
tuberculosis. It is used in

158
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,840
almost every country on Earth.

159
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,960
It's 100 years old. And it has

160
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,520
other health benefits. It helps

161
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,040
with other respiratory problems

162
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,240
and it helps with bladder

163
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,320
cancer. It has all kinds of

164
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,520
benefits. Guess what country

165
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,880
it's not used in? The United

166
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,120
States of America. That's a good

167
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,760
guess, Joe. The United States of

168
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,020
America. And why? Because the.

169
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,220
Can I guess. Yeah, please.

170
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,340
Would the patents run out? It

171
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,380
might be another reason. By the

172
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,380
way, you might be on something.

173
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,260
No, they would say, well, there

174
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,620
isn't that much tuberculosis,

175
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,740
but there's 9,000 cases a year

176
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,380
versus tetanus. Versus tetanus

177
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,340
with, you know, 13 cases every

178
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,340
10 years. I don't think most

179
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,420
people know that tetanus is a

180
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,140
bacteria. Yeah. It's not

181
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,940
transmissible. And many vaccines

182
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,420
don't stop transmission anyway,

183
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,580
by the way. I'm not saying they

184
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,780
all don't work. I'm just saying

185
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,780
you have to make a decision.

186
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,640
Imagine this. Some parents don't

187
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,600
want their kids to play football

188
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,680
because they might have a head

189
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,960
injury. Right? But if the

190
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,160
government mandated that you

191
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,440
play football, we'd all be

192
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,960
pretty pissed off. Parents

193
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,400
decide whether their kids can

194
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,200
take the bike out after sundown,

195
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
whether they can sleep over at

196
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,760
somebody's house. They make all

197
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,160
these decisions about safety,

198
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,760
but they give over this vaccine

199
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,640
decision as if it's not their

200
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,410
business. And, you know,

201
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,730
something that Bobby Kennedy is

202
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,890
pushing for and I think will

203
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,370
accomplish is called joint

204
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,330
decision making. And that is

205
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,810
that the parent and the

206
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,450
pediatrician will decide

207
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,210
together on whether or not

208
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,690
vaccines, when to give them,

209
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,570
how many, which type, et cetera.

210
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,650
Guess who opposes that? The

211
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,290
pediatricians. Right. Is that

212
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,530
because of financial incentives?

213
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,530
Holy shit. Yes. When I was a

214
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,970
kid, I went to the pediatrician.

215
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,970
Well, first of all, I went to

216
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,360
the doctor once. I broke my

217
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,760
foot. If you didn't have

218
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,480
vaccines and Bobby's wellness

219
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,800
checks and little Jamie's

220
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,800
wellness checks that are

221
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,000
necessary, that, you know, they

222
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
bring you in to get the

223
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,160
vaccines, pediatricians would

224
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,200
have to have second jobs because

225
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
most kids, particularly when

226
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,480
they're younger and they're not

227
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,960
yet affected by all the

228
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,080
environmental toxins, most kids

229
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,800
are pretty healthy. Obviously,

230
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,120
that's less true today than it

231
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,330
was when I was a kid. But I

232
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,450
wanna share something that I'm

233
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,610
itching to get out because most

234
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,850
people just don't know much

235
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,210
about vaccines. And there's

236
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,330
information that's all available

237
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,290
through CDC and fda, et cetera,

238
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,450
that I wanna share if you give

239
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,050
me permission. Sure. Okay. So

240
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,330
how does it start? Vaccine it

241
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,290
means, you know, it started from

242
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,810
the word cow vodka. It meant

243
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,330
cow. So they would take pus,

244
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,010
cow pus, you don't wanna waste

245
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,410
that stuff. And they would rub

246
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,290
that into wounds on people. And

247
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,570
then they decided, oh, maybe we

248
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,690
can put horse pus and cow pus

249
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,290
from an infected horse's hoof.

250
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,050
We'll rub that in. And they,

251
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,870
and for a long time they were

252
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,150
experimenting with all these

253
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,550
things. Some old timey vaccines

254
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,030
were made by. I'm gonna read it

255
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,990
so I get it right. Steeping them

256
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,790
for years in a mix of ox bile

257
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,190
and glycerin and potato slices.

258
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,670
Sounds like a joke, right? But

259
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,910
it's true. But science moved on

260
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
and it evolved to where vaccines

261
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,070
included dried rabbit spinal

262
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,070
cords, duck embryos, chicken

263
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,870
blood, human bile. Cause you

264
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,420
don't wanna waste that ground up

265
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,020
rat spleens and boiled pig skin.

266
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,140
So that's old time vaccines

267
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,580
before we knew anything about

268
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,860
anything. So let's switch to the

269
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,140
modern day vaccines because

270
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,380
obviously now we're real smart

271
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,380
and we know a lot of stuff.

272
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,100
Well, here is what's in your

273
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,660
childhood vaccines right now.

274
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,460
Gelatin from boiled pig skin,

275
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,580
kind of like the old one.

276
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,940
Chicken embryo protein, blood

277
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,060
from the hearts of cow fetuses.

278
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,420
DNA fragments from human

279
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,380
fetuses. Oil extracted from

280
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,460
shark livers. I mentioned

281
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,420
earlier, proteins from worm

282
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
ovaries, because you don't want

283
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,760
to leave that out. And of course

284
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,640
DNA fragments from monkey

285
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,920
kidneys. Now if that doesn't

286
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,120
sound like a Shakespeare play.

287
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,880
You know that eye of newt, toe

288
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,800
of frog, lizard's leg, tongue of

289
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,360
dog. When I hear that thing from

290
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,560
Macbeth, I literally can't you

291
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,520
just picture Gates and Offit and

292
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,280
Hotez sitting around in their

293
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,040
witches brew putting this stuff

294
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,920
together. I know I'm talking

295
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,530
fast, I'm almost done. The other

296
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,090
modern ingredients in childhood

297
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,490
vaccines, this is what you are

298
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,890
giving if you trust the vaccine

299
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,290
manufacturers. Formaldehyde, we

300
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,370
already know that's bad.

301
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,690
Polysorbate 80, which is linked

302
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,730
to infertility. And my absolute

303
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,490
favorite, potassium chloride.

304
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,810
Why is this my favorite?

305
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,930
Because that is the chemical

306
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,690
that is injected as the third

307
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,890
injection in lethal injections

308
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,900
by executioners. Now admittedly

309
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,820
infants get far less of it than

310
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,820
people who are executing. But we

311
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,340
really want to be injecting any

312
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,900
amount of that into human

313
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,420
beings. Sodium borate, Triton X,

314
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,060
that's what's in spermicides.

315
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,020
And of course until very

316
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,900
recently, ethylmercury. And what

317
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,340
is the reason why they have so

318
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,860
many different ingredients? So I

319
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,100
got it in this book, holding up

320
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,500
shameless plug. I got it in this

321
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,820
book because it's too long for

322
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,500
now. But they have, you can get

323
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,040
it from ChatGPT. They have what

324
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,920
I would have to call a kind of

325
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,680
insane reason for each of these.

326
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
Right? I mean, you just heard

327
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,000
what they are. I mean they're,

328
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,960
they're, they're nuts. And

329
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
people say, well, I'm not a

330
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,880
scientist. You don't realize how

331
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,080
very important each one of those

332
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,600
ingredients is. Well, I do

333
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,760
realize something and I don't

334
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,760
have to be a scientist. I don't

335
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,000
want mercury injected into my

336
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,240
kids, period. If, when I was a

337
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,610
kid, if a light fell and broke

338
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,170
on the floor, you had to call a

339
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,090
hazmat team to get rid of it

340
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,050
because it had mercury. You

341
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,970
can't touch it, you can't

342
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,130
breathe it, you can't eat it,

343
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,490
but you can inject it into

344
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,570
babies. It's actually, it's

345
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,530
crazy. And vaccinologists,

346
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,210
there's a degree of mad science

347
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,690
here, There's a degree of

348
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,970
craziness. And again, I'm still

349
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,410
not anti vaxx. That's not the

350
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,450
point. The point is learn which

351
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,450
products you think matter

352
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,210
because they're not all the

353
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,370
same. And what are they saying

354
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,730
is the reason why they have all

355
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,970
these different ingredients like

356
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,890
monkey kidneys and well, some.

357
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,450
Of them are, I mean, it's not.

358
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,570
The one that's not funny, of

359
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,730
course is SV40 because simian

360
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,330
virus 40, most people don't

361
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,730
know, was in the first polio

362
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,850
vaccine which was recalled and

363
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,410
then it was in the second polio

364
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,170
vaccine which was put out to

365
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,490
replace the one that had simian

366
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,250
virus 40. It was in that and

367
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,530
it's in the Pfizer COVID

368
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,890
vaccine, SV40 fragments. And if

369
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,290
you could explain how that

370
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,840
happened. Well, they will claim

371
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,840
that they were that to grow the

372
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
pathogen needs to be in some

373
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,560
kind of organic material and

374
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,840
that monkey kidneys is a good

375
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,200
way to do it. So simian virus 40

376
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
accidentally, they claim,

377
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,400
accidentally got into it. Let me

378
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,160
tell you what they claim for

379
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,280
mercury because it's a good

380
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,200
story too. They say that it's a

381
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,080
preservative and that they

382
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,000
needed it for multi dose vials

383
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,530
of the flu vaccine. Not legal in

384
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,330
the uk, not in Denmark, not in

385
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,570
Sweden, not in Switzerland, but

386
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,530
for some reason in the United

387
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,970
States it's okay until Bobby

388
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,930
Kennedy took it out. I mean that

389
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,810
committee, that Robert Malone is

390
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,410
on, the ACIP committee that

391
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,970
decides on childhood vaccines.

392
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,410
So why is this stuff in there?

393
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,210
Well, two reasons. One is that

394
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,330
once they get a vaccine

395
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,530
approved, the last thing they

396
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,130
want to do is come back to the

397
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,810
FDA and start that process all

398
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,230
over again to get a better

399
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,550
vaccine approved. Because it'll

400
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,390
cost billions of dollars.

401
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,510
Because it'll cost a lot.

402
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,430
Because now it will. It takes a

403
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,350
long time and it won't get

404
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,950
passed. Right. Right now the

405
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,590
ACIP committee. I mean, it's

406
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,630
happening right now. There's a

407
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,030
new moderna vaccine, and the

408
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,950
ACIP committee is saying to fda,

409
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,510
give me all the information on

410
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,830
this vaccine before we approve

411
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,670
it. And there is no safety, no

412
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,350
viable safety information on

413
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,870
these vaccines, particularly the

414
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:31,950
childhood vaccines. There never

415
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,150
was, as you learn from turtles

416
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,670
all the way down, never a viable

417
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,990
study on these. And the studies

418
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,750
they did would be some of them

419
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,510
for five days, some of them for

420
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,710
14 days. And I'm interested in

421
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,710
going a little longer than that

422
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,230
when it comes to my kids meaning

423
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,910
to know whether they had adverse

424
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,990
reactions. Well, they would

425
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,550
always quote. They always say

426
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:52,670
that there have been numerous

427
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,870
studies and these studies are

428
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,990
published. And then when RFK

429
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,200
pushed them on this and force

430
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
them to reveal the fact that no,

431
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,480
there weren't any studies that

432
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,040
showed it. Yeah. And there were

433
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,720
no. They had never done a study.

434
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,200
There are now three, but not

435
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,640
done by the government, of

436
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,080
comparing vaccinated kids to

437
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,080
unvaccinated kids for all health

438
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,639
outcomes. If you give a kid a

439
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,280
measles vaccine, it'll stop them

440
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,240
from getting measles for many

441
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,320
years. It works. But does it

442
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,880
also have other adverse effects?

443
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,040
Right. So the three studies have

444
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,670
been done and many, many more

445
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,030
problems among vaccinated kids

446
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,270
unrelated to the disease.

447
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,590
Therefore, I'm talking about

448
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,470
asthma and ADHD and neurological

449
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,870
problems and visits to the

450
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,630
pediatrician. It's the easiest

451
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,790
study in the world to do because

452
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,830
you go to a big company like

453
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,070
Kaiser, they got the kid, they

454
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,670
know he went in for a vaccine or

455
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,990
didn't, and they know how many

456
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:48,750
visits he had to the

457
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,830
pediatrician. And so they can

458
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,150
look very easily at it. It's not

459
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,430
a hard project to do. And that's

460
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,830
what Bobby and Adele Bigtree

461
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,090
both went done by CDC and nih.

462
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,250
And that's the meeting where

463
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,810
Fauci said, oh, yeah, I have

464
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,450
that study. And he did this

465
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,690
looking through a file box. Oh,

466
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,050
I can't find it. I'll send it to

467
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,770
you. And then they had to sue to

468
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,050
get it. And right before showing

469
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,050
up in court, they get the

470
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,050
letter, oh, there is no such

471
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,090
study. Yeah, lying. I can't say

472
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,890
the phrase. Lying bastards. I

473
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,970
can say that one, right? Yeah,

474
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,810
you can say whatever you want,

475
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,010
motherfuckers. There you go.

476
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,050
Thank you. That's right. Yeah.

477
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,290
And not just a lying

478
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,330
motherfucker, but a lying

479
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,750
motherfucker with a pardon. It

480
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,190
goes back to 2014. Yeah, and why

481
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,950
would it. Why would you even do

482
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,190
that? Why would you give a

483
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,790
doctor who saved millions of

484
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,430
lives from the pandemic, why

485
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,670
would you give him a pardon.

486
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,830
That goes back to 2014? Seems

487
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,790
insane. It seems insane that you

488
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,430
would even need something like

489
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,710
that. I'll add one more

490
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,110
ingredient. He wasn't charged

491
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,710
with anything. Right. So pardons

492
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,190
are typically for people who are

493
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,390
charged with something, not for

494
00:14:52,890 --> 00:15:04,080
people who might be Sam.
